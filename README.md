**CLassic Autosport Liveries**

The idea is for this webpage to be a hub for the most iconic Autosport liveries from the 1970s to the 2000s
This includes seperate references to individual teams, automotive entities and brands so long as their livery for that sport is deemed "iconic"


The idea of this website is to be a source of practice and growth in raw HTML/CSS. 
The objective is that over the span of several months, a reasonable facsimile to a well-made website would be the result.
